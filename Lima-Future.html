						This returns the list of all possibilities for combining elements of all the input <code>lists</code> in the order they appear.
						<p class=example>
							<code>
								x = {1 2}
								y = {3 4}
								cartesian[x y]

							</code>

								 {1 4 6}
								 {1 5 6}
								 {2 3 6}
								 {2 4 6}
								 {2 5 6}
								}
								;;]
							</code>
							
							also the cartesian of a single list just returns that list's elements wrapped in their own object:
							<code>
								cartesian[{1 2 3}]
								;; returns: {{1}{2}{3}}
	
							</code>
						</p>
						
						<p>The cartesian product is not commutative.</p>
						
						<p>	This function is useful for creating tuples and other arrays.
							For example, <code>cartesian[int flo]</code> creates a tuple-type, objects of which are lists where the first element is an <code>int</code> and the second is a <code>flo</code>.

									<p>	Values enumerated before the opening bracket (<code>groupExpressions</code>) are the members grouped by.
										The <code>value</code> is the value given to each grouped item in the resulting list (often would be an object),

										<div class=example>

												;; returns { {a='a' mod5=0} {a='x' mod5=3} }
											</code></div>
										</div>
									</p>
									<p>	<code>@k</code> and <code>@v</code> are used to access the key and value of a given item itself.
										<code>#</code> is used to access variables from an upper-level statements.

						There can be any number of <code>wordforms</code> (and their corresponding <span class=statements></span>).
						A wordform consists of one or more <code>values</code>, <code>parse</code> function calls, and <i>variable-building</i>.
						<i>Variable-building</i> puts elements from the sequence into a variable and 
							is denoted by putting an <code>@</code> in front of a variable in the <code>wordform</code>.

					</p>
					<p>	If one of the <code>wordforms</code> match, it executes the <code>statements</code> without any side affects 
							(all parameters and external variables are treated as pass-by-value parameters).
						You can throw a <code>parse.mismatch</code> if at any point you decide the wordform should not have matched.
						Once the original parent <span class=parse></span> call figures out which cull statements matched, it runs the functions with their side affects.
						This way, only statements in matching wordforms are run.

						If there are more than one matching wordforms with the same length, the first one is taken (looking from top to bottom).

				The Lima version is much clearer than the pure javascript version (who can keep track of all those <code>match</code> indexes?) and not much longer.
				The gotchas and obscurities of regex make it a pain to use and a hazard to maintain, and there's absolutely not nice error messages in that parser without a lot of extra work.
				By contrast, the PEG parser will give nicer error messages, but has limited means of specifying repeated clauses and no parameterization.
			</div>
		</p>
			
		<p>	Also, in Lima all this symmetry could be combined into logical parts:
			<div><code>										
				var romanNumeralPlaces = { 						
					1000:{primary='M' fiveTimesPrimary=''  tenTimesPrimary=''}  ;; thousands
					100: {primary='C' fiveTimesPrimary='D' tenTimesPrimary='M'}	;; hundreds
					10:  {primary='X' fiveTimesPrimary='L' tenTimesPrimary='C'}	;; tens
					1:   {primary='I' fiveTimesPrimary='V' tenTimesPrimary='X'}	;; ones
				}
										
				var romanNumeral = parse[
				 int result:
					result=0
					var sum
					df romanNumeralPlaces place weight:	;; loop through each decimal place
					 	cull[
						 romanNumeralPlace[place... sum]:
							result += weight*sum;
						]
				]
				
				var romanNumeralPlace = parse[
				 primary fiveTimesPrimary tenTimesPrimary result:
					var[lowerChar primaryString]
					
					cull[
					 primary tenTimesPrimary: 	result += 9
					 primary fiveTimesPrimary: 	result += 4
					 y=parse.n[fiveTimesPrimary 0 1] x=parse.n[primary 0 1]: 
						result += x.len + 5*y.len
					]
				]
			</code></div>
			
			And its only a few lines longer. With a more complicated parsing requirement, 
				<code>parse</code> can allow for much shorter (and more readable) code than either regex or even a full-fleged parser generator like YACC/Lex or PEG.

			<li title="Translators in lima">	
				<p>In Lima, internationalization could be done using the concept of translators.
					A translator is a function that takes one input - a value, to translate - 
						and returns a value in another language.
					The value would be in some standard format, say a string in english or an integer.
					The translator function itself could be as simple as a map that can only translate specific phrases
						(similar to localized property files in Java),
						or can be as complex as a full langauge translator able to translate arbitrary structures.
					
					<div><code>
						dateTranslator.from['en'].to['en'].translate['monday']
						dateTranslator.from['en'].to['en'].translate['am']
					
						var spanishTranslator = translatorFactory.from['en'].to['es']
						spanishTranslator.translate['one'] ;; would return 'uno'
					
						var romanjiTranslator = translatorFactory.from['en'].to['ja' 'romanji']
						romanjiTranslator.translate['one'] ;; would return 'ichi'
						
						var smartTranslator = englishTranslatorFactory.context['businessMumboJumbo']
						smartTranslator.translate["Let's discuss that later"] ;; might return "Let's table that for now" or "Lets put a pin in that"
						smartTranslator.translate["What is your request?"]     ;; might return "Whats the ask?"

						translator.translate[{animal="dog" feet=4}]  ;; could return "perro tiene cuatro patas"

				== FEATURE FREEZE (things to think about, but not to implement in the first version) ==

        Make sure you're doing characters/graphemes correctly:
        * site.icu-project.org/home
        * http://userguide.icu-project.org/intro
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode

		An alternative object creation macro that allows property reordering so you can define things in logical groupings
		without worrying about where their dependencies are defined. This requires an explicity way to figure out which
		properties each statement is defining (which isn't generally possible in a normal object). Eg every defined property
		is defined with a bare colon (no macro wrappings or anything):
			configObject[
				rightMargin: width-leftMargin+position.x
				leftMargin: width/10

				position: {x=30 y=40}

			 	width: 50
				height: 100
			]


		Maybe make a typecond macro that matches types (that then can be used during static analysis), or maybe just use cond:

		cond typematch[v]
			a: ...
			b: ...


        Have a way to bind an attribute for a whole module (rather than just setting for a particular call-stack).

		== interface-locked objects ==

		interface-locked objects - have a way to lock an object into a particular interface, so that even if that object has additional functionality, it can't be accessed through the interface-locked reference. This is so you can ensure strict adherance to interfaces (like you're forced to in java). Example:

		var x = {
		  var[a = 5  b = 10]
		}
		var interface = {var a}

		var lockedX = interface.lock[x]

		lockedX.a ; 5
		lockedX.b ; error
		lockedX.a = 8
		x.a ; 8

		This could be called 'downcast' (vs a normal cast which is an upcast)


		== rethinking generics ==

		Would it be possible to have capture types from parameters in Lima? Eg:

		int x = 5
		frac y = 3.4
		var f = fn list[?] x ? y:
		   x.=ins[y]
		fn![getType[a]][a:] = fn a:
		  ret

		Could use a macro:
		fn ptype[T list[T] x T y]:
		  x.=ins[y]

		ptype T:
		  fn![T] x = fn T a T b:
			 ret a+b

		Except how does it then know what T will be? Maybe you can grab the type off any object:

		fn! x = fn a b:
			assert[meta[a].type.values.has[b] & meta[b].type.values.has[a]]
			var result = a+b
			assert[meta[a].type.values.has[result]

		However, this won't affect dispatch.. maybe you need a way to relate types within dispatch.

		type.cond[meta[a].type.values.has[b]
		

		== debugger UI ==

		Highlight the whole statement that is currently being executed (which might be part of a line or more than one line) *and* the operation/function currently being executed in a different color, so you can easily see where things are at.


		== other ==

		Maybe pull the number formatting into a standard number formatting module

        Maybe allow overriding ~ and ~> if you inherit from a reference: {mix[someRef~]}

        Question: what do you do about attribute name collisions?
        * Eg. What if a submodule requires a same-named attribute that a supermodule defines
           Answer: The supermodule should be aware of the submodule's required attributes and shouldn't use that name
        * Eg. But what if the submodule changes later to require that name?
          Answer: Perhaps there can be some module upgrading analysis that can warn the programmer about a case like that.
                  When you build, it could analyze the modules that directly use attributes and complain if a module that wasn't using an attribute starts using it?
        * Eg. What if an objects methods are given a different attribute value than the object's constructor?
          Answer: The object should grab a copy of that attribute's value in the constructor
        * What do you do about running module definitions? Do you have to surround the module loading in an attribute block as well?
			
        * probability and value duality/multiplicity - maybe call it something like unsurity or .. i like multiplicit value		
		* how do you describe a probability map that doesn't have full information?
			* Like lets say you know that a value from 0 to 3 is returned 90% of the time, but you're not sure what happens the other 10% of the time
			* It might have to provide a range of possibilities, especially if you want the probabilities over a range that covers 
				some knowns and some unknowns, for example (using the same 90% 10% example) if you want to know the probability that you get 
				a value from 0 to 5, the answer would be between 90% and 100%.
			* this goes back to an object representing a set of values
				* numbers could be extended to be sets, and operations like + and * can operate on all the members,
					while testing operations like < and == can mean "are all the members less than?" or "are all the members equal to?"
					and you'd have to have separate operations to describe "are some of the members less than" etc.
			* A scratchpad example of what it might look like for you to "know that a value from 0 to 3 is returned 90% of the time, but you're not sure what happens the other 10% of the time":
			probability.mass[ 
			   ret {
			 	 0 .. 3 : .9 ... 1
			     else : 0 ... .1
			   }
			]
			or maybe
			probability.mass[ 
			   ret {
			 	 0 .. 3 : .9
			     else : 0 .1
			   }
			]

		* You should be able to get an AST representation of any lima object, as well as be able to get a string representation

		* maybe remove con.cr and con.bs and add an encoding object for ASCII that has those available
            * why?
			  		
			
		* Think about how you would be able to put in dependency constraints into a system, something like private/public kinds of things in classes, but at a higher level. 
			Like saying that a particular module can access some set of other modules, but not others. Strong coupling is a huge problem in programming			


        * If we remove the restriction that binary operators can't return macros, how will lima decide how to execute an expression
                that has a macro as the second operand of a binary operator?
			* eg a^macroB:{macroArgument1}*macroC:{macroArgument2}+d
			  since macroC needs to be evaluated before we can know whether the * has a higher or lower precedence than ^,
				if ^ returns a macro, macroC might not ever be evaluated at all
            * The best answer is to run the macro as an isolate and evaluate the result
			* Nixed ideas:
                * This could be resolved if a constraint was introduced: macros can't mutate outside state (so that it can be evaluted and disgarded)
                * The answer is: if you can't resolve it, ask the programmer


		* Maybe stack traces should shorten paths (eg base everything on the main executable path
			
		* think about whether to add a function 'guarantee' (maybe with an easier to type name) that allows you to do things like
		  put time constraints on a block of code (say, to guarantee that the time between an event happening and outputting of 
          something takes between x and y milliseconds)
		
		* Lima probably needs a way to query the system for available resources (cores, cpu availability, memory availability, power avilability, etc)
		
		
		* look at Closure Protocols and protocol-based inheritance/polymophism
			* badly written article: http://jeditoolkit.com/2012/03/21/protocol-based-polymorphism.html
		
        * consider adding a timeout function:
          timeout 0.03: ;; 30 milliseconds
             ;; do something
           else:
             ;; timeout handling  		
                	
			
		* Think about what DNS features are available (http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava/dnsjava-current/examples.html)
			* getting the current computer's ip address and/or name
			* setting(?) MX records
			* getting the version of the remote server
			* zone transfer
			* DNS dynamic update (?)
	
    
    

   		* think about using objects' identies as enums and other things that need a unique identifier
   			* objects' identies as in ??
   			* That way you can ask if something is actually the specific error you're looking for (for example) instead of just an error that looks the same
   			* revisit enums (in the concepts section) with this in mind

    
    	* possibly note that lima does *not* use delegation although it does use prototypical inheritance
			* Despite many stupid things in ambienttalk, they describe prototypical inheritance well:
 			 	AmbientTalk�s object instantiation protocol closely corresponds to class instantiation in class-based languages. 
				  The major difference lies in the evaluation context of the init method: in a class-based language, 
				  the constructor is ran in the context of an empty object, freshly allocated from the class blueprint. 
				  In AmbientTalk, the init method is ran in the context of a shallow copy of an original object. 
				  Hence, in the init method, fields do not necessarily contain nil values: they have the value of the clonee. 
				  This can sometimes be useful to express the state of a clone as a delta w.r.t. the state of its clonee.


        * lime (lima's package manager) should have the following functionality (commandline or as a module):
            * check what libraries are out of date (and what the version differences are)
            * automatically update to the highest version in the same major version number for each module
                * e.g. if a module has the versions: 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and the current version is 1.0.0, doing this will upgrade to version 1.1.0

        
        * consider adding a method v and changing keys to be k on lists that would be used like this:
           x = {1 2 3}
           x.v[0] == 1 & x[[v==2]][0] == nil & x[[v==2]].v[0] == 2
           * this would be so that things like filter and find that return keys unmodified can be used more easily 
           x.v[y] == x[x.k[y]]
           The alternative is to sort by key: x[[v==2]].sort[k][0] - which isn't sooo bad

        * for the package management system, allow people to sign up to receive updates on modules that *their* modules require - so people can be alerted to update appropriately


        * lima - maybe have every try-catch automatically roll back everything that happened inside it if an exception happens
	       * think about this more

		make a crypto library that doesn't suck for lima:
		* Look at how its done here: https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl - particularly useful is the "what this does/what it expects from you" parts
		Should have the basic parts:
			* SecretKeyCryptor
			* nonce		
		Scratchpad:
			salt - needed for password protection (different value stored with each password hash)
			nonce - needed for any encryption (there to ensure every message is reasonably unique)
		
		* Make sure you give clear options for cipher modes for algorithms that can use multiple cipher modes
		* look up key derivation techniques and evaluate whether any are standard enough to include in the library.
		* Also need to pay attention to message padding or key padding.
		* Having something like the randomizer specified using parameters indicating how random you need/want it to be may not work with encryption. It would only work if all encryption and decryption is done only using the program at hand (which is probably  not a good assumption).
		* Maybe have something like:
			crypto.enc[message nonce "m+n"] 
		where 
			"m+n" is a pattern indicating where the nonce goes. 
		This would allow flexibility and preciseness of nonce placement while ensuring there *is* in fact a nonce. 
		You could always get around this by passing a blank nonce. Not sure how reasonable this is
		
		
		* Make lima's package format available as easy libraries for all popular languages so they will use it too. 
            Then make a translator into lima for some of them - which means you could load say ruby or c or python source 
            files and use them in a lima program for free
		
		* What texture params are there?
		* what texture.image params are there?
		* What cshape blending options are there?
		* what about alpha channels on colors?
		
   		* organize your list of custom functions (and other things) into sections
   			* or possibly get rid of the custom function section and just have cateogries like you already do for 
			   		* functins and methods
			   		* operators
			   		* etc
		
		* probably implement atomic blocks using software transactional memory (as at least one possible piece)
			* This is where statements are executed optimistically logging all state changes and 
				consistency is checked at the end (to make sure no other source has Fd with the state during that time)
				and if something has Fd with it, then everything is rolled back
				* apparently this requires that all the statements only have revokable actions
				* but maybe you can make everything revokable by waiting to execute output until the end of the atomic block
					* while this restricts what can be done in atomic block, maybe it simply doesn't make sense to have
						temporally sequential activity executed "atomically" 
						- since its technically not possible to send a request and receive a response at the same time (atomically)
		
		* write a conecpt for inaccuracy optimizations
   		
		* consider the idea that lima doesn't need any syntactic sugar - in fact syntactic sugar might indicate a problem in a langauge. 
		   It also creates a problem - redundant ways to define things
		   * Lima doesn't need syntactic sugar because it has semantic sugar - ie arbitrary custom functions that can be defined by the user
		
		* maybe Note that lima's mix and use inclusions and exclusions are a lot like trait imports in AmbientTalk http://soft.vub.ac.be/amop/at/tutorial/modular
		
		* Think about ambienttalk's concept of object "tagging" (like empty interfaces in java) - might be a good concept for certain constraints in Lima
		   * http://soft.vub.ac.be/amop/at/tutorial/modular
		   * this could be implemented by requiring that an object explicitly inherit from a particular object somehow
		
			
		More precisely define interface typing so that an object that had a function that will take a var matches the interface of A function that takes an int
			
   		* Possibly when two operators conflict and can't be proven one way or the other to have the same affect,
   			Run them both in isolation and if they both produce the same result, do it
   			If they don't, or if they create messages to outside the system that might change the state of the outside world,
			   then fail.
			* robbert suggested giving the programmer some control over whether they want an operator to fail if it can't prove the functions are equal or whether they want to run both functions and ensure that the result is equal (which would be pretty non-performant)
		

   		* write a copyright license that allows lima to be freely used, but stipulates that 
			A. I be given credit for the language design
			B. To be called Lima or anything like Lima, the implementation must match the spec (including giving the correct output for a test program), and
			C. may not introduce any language extensions to the core language - any construct must be buildable from lima's core constructs
   		
   		
		* Should be able to specify external costs as well as internal costs.
		   * e.g. if you call a mysql server, depending on the size of hte table it might have a different cost. This cost would be invisible to the system unless you explicitly include it.
		
		* maybe functions used to create a probability map need to be integratable too so they can calculate percentile
			* maybe just throw an exception when something is requested that can't be calculated (like an inverse or an integral)
		
		* (Scratch this) Lima should have annotations for where the compiler should focus its time (the bottlenecks) 
 		  * Question: is there some way a compiler can *always* identify bottlenecks better than the programmer? 
		   	Seems like the answer should be yes for the same reason the answer is yes to 
			"can the compiler always be better at optimizing than the programmer?" 
			- anything you can do yourself, you can tell your compiler to do. 
		
		* Seems like the language needs to have an easier way to override inherited methods
			For example, this is how you'd have to do it today:
				object = {
					fn! method = fn:
						;; do something	
				}
				
				object2 = {use[object[method:objectMethod]]
					fn! method = fn:
						objectMethod[]
						;; do more stuff
				}
				
			but i really want something like:
				
				object2 = {use[object]					
					override fn! method = fn:
						thisfn.parent.object[]
						;; do more stuff
				}
			or maybe:
				
				object2 = {use[object]					
					// first two arguments are passed to the overridden function
					override fn! method = fn thisfn.parent.object[2] c d: 
						;; do more stuff
				}
		
		* Haskell has three exponentiation operators!  This is because there�s a difference in what the three of them mean in some cases, so you get your choice.
		
		* Mention that lima is conducive to Language Oriented Programming as described here: http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/articles/04/10/lop/6.html
		
		* conceptually an object keeps track of the identies of what objects' interfaces it implements
		
		* You might be able to statically map javascript exceptions to lima exceptions (ie leveraging the underlying system to generate lima exceptions much faster)
		  * http://helephant.com/2007/05/12/diy-javascript-stack-trace/ - for browsers that don't do exceptions well
		  * rhino doesn't support function.callee or function.caller but it should be easy to add in there in generated code (just set those values on the function before you call it, or pass in a variable or something)
		
		* Link to this somewhere in your docs as to why dogma is stupid, and so are idioms: http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/AUG_19_2012.html
		
		* Should be able to specify output ability as well as input behavior for optimizations
   			* what does output ability mean?

		Lima oips contest - obfuscated in plain sight. rules: standard indentation and formatting.

		* function inverse (quote from an earlier spec):
			May optionally take additional parameters which define some or all of the input parameters
				as they would be after completion of the original function 
				(this may be neccessary for functions that mutate their inputs).
		
		* A meta function (meta[object]) can be used to grab an object's meta data
			* this meta data can contain the members an object should have and their constraints (among other things)
			* interfaces would have the meta data for members, but wouldn't neccessarily have the members themselves

		anti aliasing blockyness should probably be described as a number from 0 to 00, where 0 is 100% blocky and 00 is 100% smooth.
			* a value of 2 indicates that each dimension is split into two parts - meaning that you get 4 subpixels per pixel
			* a value of 10 would mean you have 100 subpixels
			* a value of 00 effectively makes it continuous which makes coloring 100% precise
		
		Still confused as to how you describe color blending
			* to be 100% precise, you need to split each pixel into exact proportions and then blend each color with that proportion
			* you can describe this process to be less precise by only choosing a minumum number of colors to blend, 
				or maybe choosing a minimum proportion of the pixel that needs to be covered before blending
				* but this kind of describes a process *across* objects
				* is there any way to describe this in each object individually?
					* seems like you'd have to do it on a per-pixel basis - not per object
					
   		* For optimization plugins:
				* have a hook for meta-information gatherers that scan the (Lima) program and can set arbitrary describing attributes on a variable
				* when an optimizer transforms something using a higher-level construct 
					(something that isn't in the basic syntax and functionality), have it somehow describe the parts of that 
					higher-level construct in terms of basic functionality, so that other optimizers can still re-optimize it if 
					it fits a pattern that can optimize further
		
		* consider changing the color objects to use wavelengths or something rather than rgb values
			* also figure out how you can incorporate different color spaces (similar to incorporating different encodings?)
		
		* Window anti aliasing - so from what I can gather, this has to do with how pixles are created from a downsampled image 
			(e.g. when an image is farther away in a 3d scene) when a single pixel has multiple colors in it. 
			Open question: is there a standard way to measure the realism? I kinda doubt it. 
			Since there probably is no way to measure how "real" a rendering should look, we'd have to fall back on simply choosing the algorithm ourselves - ie when we create a view or something.
			* Ask holmes if there's any way to measure anti-aliasing realism
				* holmes mentioned looking up error metrics around cublic splines
			* If not, might just have to specify a specific sampling function
				* maybe you can describe attributes you want the sampling function to have
				
		* inaccuracy optimization where object's positions are rounded to the nearest pixel - or something like that
			* have boundaries like "shape's position can error at most x" or "shape's rotation can error at most x"
				* this can potentially depend on the object's distance from view positions
		
		* possibly describe an anti-aliasing algorithm with the range 0 to 1 where 0 is fully 'blocky' and 1 is fully 'smooth'
			* note that blocky has the most contrast and smooth has the least			
			
   		* How do you describe that your circle, for example, can be drawn with at most a certain precision
   			* which would allow it to actually draw the circle using less polygons than would allow your screen to have the maximum precision
   			* Maybe have a minimum number of polygons you use
   			* Or maybe maximum difference in volume is a better metric
   		
		* Possibly describe optimization ability of certain shapes (allowing the shapes to be modified to be easier to draw) 
				by indicating reduced monitor resolution - ie allowing the drawing of a particular shape to pretend that 
				the monitor is at a lower resolution that it really is. 
			This way it could draw more choppily than it would otherwise. 
			However, I'm thinking this doesn't seem like it would work to specify the reduction of verticies 
			(and thus polygons) in a shape necessarily. Maybe there'd be two types of specification - 
			you could say "for simplifying verticies, pretend monitor is this resolution" and for choppyness 
			say "for simplifying pixel output, pretend monitor is this resolution" - not sure how encompassing that is


		* should be able to specify output ability as well as input behavior for optimizations
			* e.g. monitor will have resolution beween x and y

		* when describing optimization stuff, you should be able to create arbitrary variables you want to optimize
			* be able to weight them differently so your compiler can make appropriate trade offs
			* speed, memory, and power aren't the only things - a user could specify other things like maximum cpu usage (vs program speed),
			readability of output (if you're compiling into another language), or  cost, "complexity" (defined in some user-specific way), or number of components  (if you're compiling into say a schematic that uses physical components,
			so you don't have to do as much work to put it together)

		Think about how to do something like what CSS does, but in an application programming interface. 
		This would require having some kind of hooks in objects that change when you change your "style sheet". 
		Is this even necessary? It sounds useful, for sure.
		
		* add to pack:
			* Some ability to check if there are newer major or minor versions for a library.
		
		* Think about having the safe-navigation operator return a nil with an 'app' method, so you can create new lists from nil
			* e.g. 
				var x = nil
				x.app[1 2 3] 	;; x now is {1 2 3}

		* split up sections into Basic Lima and Lima's Standard Library, as well as probably making a separate section for	
			the "Concepts"
		
						
		* need to come up with equivalents for php functions:
			* checkdnsrr
			* dns_get_record
			* getmxrr (what are the weights? no equivalent with dns_get_record?)
		* consider a method like map and join that operates on sequences
			* so you can go through every match of a sequence or something
			* this would replace the 'replace', 'find', and 'ins' methods

		* Note that if a lima object uses two objects that have the same member, 
			they must be explicitly disambiguated *even if they are not conflicting types*
				* the reason for this is related to the reason C# uses "explicit interfaces" 
					- so that multiple interface members that have the same name but different purposes are brought the the programmer's attention
			* Wherever there is an operator for merging types, an error should happen 
				* how would you easily dedupe this
		
		* In a function, what variables can you access? 
			* What if that function's copied somewhere?	
		
		* Need some rules for what meta information is inherited when you mix or use an object in a new one	
		* Need to flesh out what meta information there needs to be for objects
		
		* object.reflect 
			* public fields
			* public const fields
			* public read-only fields
			* private fields
			* aliasing fields (fields that alias something in a higher scope)
			* addField
			* metadata
			* make sure the reflection stuff provides a way to access the 'this' of a container class from a nested class.
			* make sure theres a way to query the platform the code is running on
			* self - the object itself
			
		* stack.reflect
			* levels - a list of the stack levels currently active
			* current level - the current stack level (also tells you how many levels there are, since you are always in the deepest level)
			
		* stack level
			* name - name of the function 	
			* file - what file the source was defined in
			* source - string source of the object (as much as possible)
			* line - what line of the source file where the object was defined
			* self - the function itself
			* getlocals[level] - gets a list of the local variables inside the function at the given 'level' (where level represents a level in the call stack)
			* getUpvalues - gets a list of values in a higher scope that the function uses (ie closes over - since functions are closures)
				* theoretically this could even be variables the function doesn't use, but has access to

		* hooks - things triggered on certain events
			* function call
			* function return 
			* exception thrown out of function
			* statement execution (in lua this is a "line" event, but why pretend code is always in the form of lines?)
			
		* reflection should be able to see where methods come from (what objects they were originally from if inherited)
		    *I'm unsure if htis is actually possible 
		
		* organize concepts by type so they're more easily searchable	
			
		* have a with statement so you can do stuff like 
		   * doSomething[x[4].moose.with[ v.a==5 & v.b == 6] ] - so that you don't have to duplicate x[4].moose everywhere 
		   * Note that this is not really like python's with
		   * also not really like javascript's with, since that unload the entire namespace of an object into a block, whereas this would just create one variable (v) inside an expression
		
		
		* maybe allow an attribute to change external inputs somehow, instead of creating mock objects, create mock input	

		
		
		have a combine method for lists where
		* list.combine[expression] 
		is the same as:
		* list.map[expression.map[v2: {v v2}]].join[{} a.cat[b]
		eg
		(1..n).combine[1..(v-1)]
		  .map[{v.0 v.1 v.0+v.1}]
		  [prime[v.2]]
		This has a need for a recombine method that takes a list of lists of values instead of a simple list of values so you can do something like:
		(1..n).combine[1..(v-1)].recombine[v.1..v.0]
		Is there a simpler way to do this? 
		Can we defined combine in such a way that it will work in either case?
			
		* Can you describe an API - like a web API, using lima? You'd say stuff like it needs to be an http request that has these possible requests and responses. There should be some way to do it.	
		
			
		* Make it so "custom operator" can define any operators to be custom functions
			* This would mean that "[" is really the custom operator, and it just happens to be eneded with a close bracket

		* split should be able to split by more arbitrary sequences
			* probably requires a parser to be passed in to parse delimiters
		
		
		* consider adding value-pattern matching to lima - like this:
			fn.string[int] sayMe = fn
			 1: ret "one"
			 2: ret "two"
			 3: ret "four"
			 x: "not between 1 and 3"
			
			;; would be otherwise done as	
			fn.string[int] sayMe = fn x:
				if x == ?0::
				 1: ret "one"
				 2: ret "two"
				 3: ret "four"
				 else: "not between 1 and 3"
		
		
		Slow Lima contest - a contest for people to write two Lima programs with exactly the same results/effects but run with very difference performance characteristics. 
		A requirement here would be that the same input assertions be used in both programs. 
		This can be done in conjunction with an optimization contest intended to incentivize fixing those performance holes. 
		The optimization contest would probably be tricker, since to be good optimizations, they should be general, and yet a more specific one would perform better (be faster etc). 
		Maybe you'd just have to have standard benchmarks it has to test well for. 
		Or maybe there will be a secret modification to the original 
			program to make it do something basically the same but have a slightly different output.
		

		* Maybe allow 'mix' to work inside a function, to unroll a bunch of properties (similar to 'with' in javascript)
			NO (since mix works on `this` rather than `thisfn`, but maybe something like it?
		
		how do you do self-types in lima? Probably don't need them actually, since values aren't typed, but..
		public abstract class BaseDate {
		   <this> withYear(int year);
		}
		public final class ZonedDate extends BaseDate {
		    // withYear removed as now correctly in superclass
		}
		public final class LocalDate extends BaseDate {
		    // withYear removed as now correctly in superclass
		}
		Lima:
		BaseDate = {
		  fn.[this!] withYear = fn int year:
		    ...
		}
		ZonedDate = { mix[BaseDate] }
		LocalDate = { mix[BaseDate] }
		
		
		staticSize and dynamicSize should probably be in meta data
		
		* look into event syntax in Trellis: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/Trellis#toc
			* Got like halfway through
			* Got stuck on "Creating Generic Controllers by Sharing Cells" and resseting rules..
				 * maybe the resetting rules stuff can be done using atomic blocks
							
		* For probabilityMap.sum, what about probability densities? Do you need infinitesimals to describe pmap.sum as the 
			summed slice <code>pmap[[20<v<50]].join[0 v+v2]</code>?
			* I think you kinda do
		
		* implement types with event semantics (e.g. types would put a watch on a variable and "check" that its the right type every time it changes)
			* possibly have the realCustom function return two things - the lima to run, and the result to put in its place 
				(so that a type function can operate on a variable while leaving the variables behind for other type functions to operate on)		
			* might wanna keep things simple here
			
		* get rid of the concept of 'raised' exceptions (or whatever you want to call them) that get answered by an "answer" block
			* instead use the attribute concept to set a method that can be called somewhere within (effectively getting an "answer" that way)
			* write a concept about this (mentioning that raise-answer was a feature i had originally considered)

		Dev resource bundle:
		* source map
		* exception messages - anything from an exception that's not switched off of but instead printed out to the screen. Messages sent to a server could process the messsages using the dev bundle.


			   
		* maybe for pack, some kind of public key or other identifying information should be saved with the executable so that the
			canonical source can be validated (authenticated) when its downloaded by the end user 
		* how do you determine that for pack, that the package you download is correct 
			* have a checksum to verify the contents
			* have some way to validate the check sum (authentication)
		  * http://guide.macports.org/#development
		  * does gems do something about this?
		  	* yes, PKI: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21
		  		* this works using a web-of-trust style public key infrastructure
		  		* This allows one repository to endorse another
		  			* why would they do this?
		  				* maybe this is built in
		  				* a distribution server could simply accept trust requests
		  				* that server would check their chain of trust (or a portion of it) to determine
		  					that the requester's request is valid
		  					* valid requests might be 
								* ones that haven't requested too much trust (from to many other distro servers)
								* ones that haven't revoked their key recently (or something like that)
								* ones that don't lie about who they've requested trust from (would require them to send a list of who they've requested trust from)
		  			* how do you revoke endorsement?
		  				* possibly the endorsement can be revoked either
		  					* with a properly signed message, or
		  						* this would be useful if you lost your domain
		  					* from the expected address with a handshake ensuring a proper send receive path
		  						* this would be useful if you lost your private key


		--nix: this is already done using attributes, but write a concept about it-- Hooks for intercepting output and injecting input (from the console, network, OS, etc)
			* this is so you don't have to do as much mock-object bullshit, you can simply test inputs and outputs

		* For graphics, I like the setup of objects having subobjects, and when you draw one object, it automatically draws all 
			that object's subobjects.
			But what do you do in cases like you find in html, where you have some image or something inside a div, 
				but now want it to be relative to an outter node instead of the node its in.
			This just needs something thinking of the direct object model and other drawing schemes
		
		{} should be an operator you can define/redefined
			* need a {}= operator to define destructuring assignments
			* seems like less of a good idea now - I kind of determined that destructuring assignments need to be a language construct
		
		slima - simple lima. Modularize lima into two parts, slima and full lima which is defined in terms of slima
			* Have the symbol be a smashed lima bean
			* Have a custom function called "makeObject" that simply defines a bunch of operators that define the object
				* This is the equivalent of the way data can be defined in lisp using closures - closures can do the same work in lima
				* It's actually even more basic than lisp, since even the syntax for combination can be defined through the language (ie the operators - in lisp there's only one operator: parentheses)
				* examples:
					* functions are makeObject with some code-text passed in, and define a bracket operator that runs that code
					* normal objects are makeObject with some member definitions passed in and defines a dot operator that returns a memeber based on the name passed into it
					* list objects are makeObject with some elements passed in, and defineds a bracket operator that returns an element based on the index passed in			
	
		* Lima should be able to use libraries from theoretically any language - all mixed together. 
			It would translate those languages into lima, and then use them as normal. 
			It should theoretically be able to do this even for compiled libraries. 
			The only problem is features that a library might use that aren't compatible with the system you're in 
				- but that has a standard way of being dealt with - just thrown an unsupported exception. 
			There are things, tho, like the dom with javascript stuff, and graphics output stuff on OSs, 
				that could be translated between eachother with a little work. 
			Even some things like writing to the windows registry could be translated into writing cookies to a person's browser.
			
		* Should the random functionality be able to specify probabalistic behavior between different seeds 
			(like, a generator might generate random values for any given seed, but it might generate pretty similar sequences between seeds)
		
							
		
		* Idea: How can you make Lima 100% portable? 
			* Disallowing the program to know what system its operating on, and disallowing non-portable built-in functionality
					would make every program portable.
				* However, this would limit many things
				* A way to get around this: feature querying
				* Another way to get around this: have a special control flow operator that only takes in discrete
					* What was I going for??? I never finished this thought. 
								
		* for system calls:
		  * You should be able to pass in a window object or a window attribute object so you can 
		  	give the process a window it controls (ie if the parent process stops running, that window will still exist)
		  		* these cover some of the startupinfo and creationgflags stuff
		* How do you run a command in a specific shell? Open the shell program itself and pass in the right commands.
		* python popen replacement (http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/module-subprocess.html)
			* pid - need some way to get that
		
		
		* do echoless input via input events (with an object like you'd use to check the state of the mouse or keyboard) 
			instead of through the console		
				
		
		* python split path and splitext are just helper functions, idk why i told myself to look at them. 
			* Yes they're useful, but so what? maybe just add these convenient functions to lima's path stuff		
		* os.stat - http://docs.python.org/library/os.html
			Just gets some file attributes (more stuff to add to the lima path interface)
		* http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596155957/DomainSpecificLanguages.html
		
		* idea hidden parameter (a parameter that must be named or defaults). Why? If you want varargs and optional parameters
			* note the impossibility of using varargs with optional parameters in normal cases	


		* think about adding in concepts of non-standard calculus and hyperreal fields into lima
			* These are different values of 0 (infintesimals) and inifinity
			* Not entirely sure about this, but it seems like 00 would be defined as 1/0 and 0 would be 1/00 - zero and 00 being treated as positive values
			* to express this, the solution to x*0 = 5 would be 5/0 or 5*00

		* look into documentation generation and how to facilitate this in lima. for example:
				* http://sphinx.pocoo.org/tutorial.html
		* look at google's Noop language to get some ideas about documentation (and potentially other things):
				* http://code.google.com/p/noop/wiki/ProposalForDocumentation
				* Output-agnostic: no HTML markup in the documentation! 
				* Support for example code blocks 
					* Support for having example code verified
				* Would be nice if such a system could be integrated with version control so it could know who modified the source of a function / object when 
					(without storing all that info in source itself)
				* Usual wiki rules apply, including auto-linking CamelWords 
				* Perhaps other wiki syntax like ==headers== and [[links]]
				* Function output specifications that can propogate up functions 
					(so that you don't have to document things by hand that the compiler can generate)
				* Think about have a 'meta' attribute that describes members as metadata 
					- then you'd be able to add metadata to objects exactly like you add normal members
					* One use i can think for this is that meta data wouldn't appear in IterLists (and thus wouldn't appear in toString methods)
						* they'd only be accessible directly (or via reflection) (just like you could do with @Retention(RUNTIME) in java)
				
		* Have three ways to add documentation on a function:
			* comments after the parameters
			* a custom function that provides a way to add lots of meta data without using quotes and such
			* add info directly onto the object with the attribute 'meta'
				
		* how to extend an object with read-only members after its been created
			* probably need two methods: one that adds a method only on that object, 
				and one that retroactively adds it to all objects that inherited from that object as well
			* Revisiting this, why would someone want to do this? Why not extend the object via inhertiance as normal?
				* the problem with doing this is its hard to maintain the namespace 
					- what if a modules tries to add a read-only member of the same name as another module. 
					I can't see a way of disambiguating that.
				* The way to disambiguate it would be the same way that use and herit use to disambiguate
					* So this would have to be built into the way that use and herit work, 
						where if theres a conflict, the member is renamed
							* obviously, just like in regular inheritance member renaming, the original module
								still uses the same name for that member 
							* I was thinking this couldn't be a dynamic feature, because it would mean 
								if you extended an object midway through a program, some objects that should be the same type, 
								wouldn't have the extended members. But if theres a way to retroactively adding the extention to all object 
								that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the extended object, then it would work.								
		
				
		* There should be some way in lima to specify that some data fudging is ok (particularly in the case of threading). 
			For example, if you have a shared variable that is being incremented or something by multiple threads potentially, 
			then you should have the option to not synchronize that variable and allow some inaccuracy in the amount that variable is actually being counted. 
			Maybe this can be a 'volatile' attribute.
			
		* reversing functions should be able to treat upvalues the same as mutatable inputs 
				(you should be able to specify them)
			* you should also be able to specify that upvalues should be used *as they are*
				 - which could make for interesting possibilites		
				 
		* Should be able to grab the output-set from a function and use it as an enum
						
		* Read this: http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/the-magic-behind-parser-combinators
			and this: https://github.com/fab13n/parsec-coffee-script/blob/master/doc/parsec.txt		
			got it from here (for reference): https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS
		
		* for the parse function, allow writing arbitrary code, but spoof all external variables 
			(variables not declared inside the parse function) until the whole 
			parse function is determined. Then go through the cull "winners" and manifest the changes to those outside variables. 
			This way you can write arbitrary code inside the parse function, but make sure that only the cull winners' code 
				affects the outside program.
			
		
	
		* date parsing stuff should be full fledged parser combinators
			* parsers should be able to be combined
			* you should be able to partially parse a string (so that you can have junk on the end that remains unparsed)
			* how do you make reversible parsers
				* maybe this can be extended to reversible functions overall
					* a function is always reversible if it only uses reversible operations
					* a function may be reversible even if it uses non-reversible operations
		
		* idea: for some functions that can return multiple results (especially mathematical results), 
					return a set object that interacts identically as the values it holds, but can collapse to one primary value when neccessary
				* Example: square root
				* x/0 is not undefined (see the idea about hyperreal fields and infintesimals below)
		* 	
			<tr><td>set</td>
				<td>The (infinite) list of numbers definable in a int, from smallest to greatest.
					Note that because of the order, the index of the value 0 is at 00 (infinity), 
						the index of the value 1 is at 00+1, etc.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>set</td>
				<td>The (infinite) list of numbers definable in a fra, from smallest to greatest.
					In other words, all the real numbers.
					Note that because of the nature of the set, the index of the value 0 is at 00 (infinity), 
						the index of the value 1 is at 00+1, etc.
				</td>
			</tr>

		
		* consider allowing shadowed variable names in functions separated by an object nesting (e.g. if a function contains an object which has a method that aliases a variable, it should be ok). This would mean that any function could shadow any standard name (like 'if' or 'time')

		* consider having a separate module or object for everything related to a specific language	
			* number to word translation (to and from)
			* date translation (months, days of the week)
		

		* For custom function calls, have a way to specify the length of the body of the call, 
			so the compiler can tell if you have a syntax error in your custom functin (if it runs over or under)

		* maybe i wrote this before but have a match method that uses simple regex that returns whether or not a string matches
			* var line = stdin.cut[v.match['.*/n']]
			* looks like you need to add a function for splitting a string - tho maybe the parser function covers it (but does it cover it easily enough?). 
			* Similarly for some way of dicing up an array into parts (ie putting every 50 items into a new array).
			* maybe have a regex split method that takes regex and returns a list
			* probably a regex match method too  (possibly nix the regex split method, and just have a method that splits on an expression, 
				where you can use the regex match method)
			* Also a find method that returns all the matches (?) n a string / list
		    	* var words = line.find['%w+'] ;; returns a list of words
		 
		    	
		* Think about dart generics and how Lima generics can mesh with it		
		* Consider an exception coelescense operator (like the nil coelescense operator) 
			which would discard exceptions from the left operand and use the right operand.
		
		    
		* Think about Lua's rejection of regex: http://www.lua.org/pil/20.1.html
   			* Full regex is apparently gigantic	
					
		* Think about delgation in the prototype-based way, where an object can have a number 
			of delegate objects that dynamically define inheritance
					* eg: 
						a = {
							x = 5
							y = 5
						}
						
						Add = {
							do = fn:
								ret thiself.x + thiself.y
						}
						
						Multiply = {
							do = fn:
								ret thiself.x * thiself.y	
						}
						
						
						a.delegates.app[Add]
						
						wout[a.do] ;; prints 10
						
						a.delegates.cut[[v == Add]]
						a.delegates.app[Multiply]
						
						wout[a.do] ;; prints 25
						
			* I think this could be accomplished through the use of the reflection system (if thats designed properly)
				* It could also be pretty easily done on a per method basis 
					(but it would be more cumbersome if it needed to be done a lot)
		
		* maybe allow extending the general object by treating {} like a variable - ie you can set new values on it:
		   {}.s = 5
		   x = {}
		   wout[x.s] ;; outputs 5
		   ;; not sure if this is at all desirable, but it seems to make sense with the semantics of the language
				
		*  need some way of ensuring the garbage collector doesn't fk things up. 
			* So lima needs some way of saying "this block shouldn't have the GC run" or (hopefully) a more general solution for 
				describing runtime requirements
		
		* The always function can take in a function-value and executes it surpressing side-affects. 
			* if you're going to allow this, there should be a more general way to surpress side-affects (probably an attribute)
		
				
		* Have some way to write optimizations as a matching statement (so you can say, for example, if it matches this pattern, then transform it into something else)
	
			
		* for asfn and asobj, - thats still a danger if the user uses reflection - there should be some permissions around this)		
			* This might not be super neccessary in some situations tho, since copies of objects are usually sent
			* Maybe only allow reflection for things in the same module (and asfn and asobj are considered outside the module)
		
		    
		* think about other "composition operations" you can do with objects other than simple "everything".
		   * you already have explicit stating of members to include, explicit alisasing, and grabbing all but certain members
		   * also suggeted is the ability to grab all members except the ones with conflicting names
		   
		* Prolima - name for prolog lima custom function
		
		* think about returning by reference
		   * with return by value it is as easy as saying ret x~ to return by reference... so maybe its no big deal?
		
		* consider an accessor 'acc' extention to the object's access definition (so that you can define setting and getting at the same time)
			* it would return a reference to something
		* consider allowing the access definition thing to override the brakcet operator too
			* I dunno if this is really neccessary
		
		* https://github.com/tolmasky/language   
		
		* Think about serialization issues
		   * maybe have an attribute you put on members to mark them as transient (like in hibernate) 
		   * You still have to have designated functions that serialize and espeically unserialize (an object can serialize itself, but 
		       a *different* object must unserialize it - usually this is its prototype/parent)
		   * auto serialization/unserialization methods would be ideal (and i think very doable with a transient attribute - overridable of course)
		   * note that this doesn't work for objects with nested pointers to other objects
		      * For those you need a way to keep track of cycles, which is easy enough for one save, but tricky for multiple saves
		      * Perhaps allow objects to have an id field much like a database would (or a unique field - but then you need to define over what that field is unique) 
		      * overview of this in the context of lua http://www.lua.org/pil/12.1.2.html
		   
		* Make a note in the concepts section about putting lima code into config files like in lua: http://www.lua.org/pil/12.html
			Entry[ a b c d]
			Entry[ a b d c]
			
			local count = 0
			function Entry (b) count = count + 1 end
			dofile("data")
			print("number of entries: " .. count)
			
			int count=0
			Entry = fn: count++ 
			parseMethod[file['data'] Entry][]

		* Sain should check the type of the variable being passed in, to figure out how to parse the input
			* Add whatever constructs are neccessary to do this into the reflection system
			
		 		
		* Maybe have an operator (or function) for a sub-set like comparison that checks to make sure the 
			subset-object has as many or fewer of every object than the superset-object has
			* e.g. {1 2 3 3} would be a regular subset of {1 2 3}, but would not be this special-subset. 
			* another e.g. for {1 1 2 2 3}, {1 2 3} is a special-subset, {1 1 2 3} is too, but {1 1 1 2 3} is not. 
			* This is applicable to the chooseset function  
				
	
		* In the documentatin about operator overlaoding it says 
			"Just like for methods, when an operator is redefined on an object, only that definition is used - 
				it doesn't retain inherited operator definitions, even if those definitions could handle arguments that the new definition can't handle."
			* How can you easily extend a multimethod with another set of valid parameters without rewriting all of the parameters? There should be a way
		

			
		* 	;; right now we have simple group:
			object.group[v.productId].map[{ v[0].productId  v.join[v.price+v2.price] }]
						
			;; change to more complex but still relatively simple:
			object.group v.productId[price.join[v+v2]]
			
			;; simple:
			var x = {{a=1 b=2} {a=3 b=5} {a=1 b=9}}
			x.group[v.a].map[ v.join[v.b+v2.b] v[0].a]	;; returns {1:11 3:5}
			
			;; new:
			x.group a[b.join[v+v2] a]	;; bracket part is kinda like map
			
			;; simple:
			var x2 = { 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 }
			x2.group[v]	;; returns { {1} {2 2} {3 3} {4 4} {5 5} }
			
			;; new:
			x2.group v: v[v]	;; returns { {1} {2 2} {3 3} {4 4} {5 5} }
			;; or
			x2.group v[v]
		
		* Specifying runtime behavior contracts
			*during 
				* over the whole program
				* over a program block
				* conditionally (if certain inputs are certain values, etc)
			* constraints
				* max memory usage
					* absolute (bytes)
					* percentage (of system)
				* max cpu usage (percentage)
				* max execution time
				
		* maybe allow syntax for typing arbitrary keys like this:
			object = {
			  int[0:4 'hi':45]
			  string[1:'one' 2:'two']
			}	
		
		* For event semantics, you should have separate events for "clicked within boundaries" and "clicked the object itself" 
			- the second is basically what you have as onclick in javascript - it should be able to propogate the event if it wants to.
		
		
		* consider removing the ability to specify the return type of a function in a function-type
			* its kind of awkward because dynamic inputs could make it difficult to determine whether or not the function could violate its return value constraint
				* it could error if it ever returns something that violates the constraint,
					* but what if the function is set, and then passed to a less constraining variable - its just super awkward
				* possibly make it so the input needs to be properly constrained so that the return value can be constrained
					* ie if you can have any input, you can have any return value
				* Another possibility is that you can function values that themselves contain the constraints to error if an invalid value is returned
					* it could be specified like fn.int[ ;;[ statements ;;] ] - which would mean that the type form for this would have to be fn.int![...]
			* what i'm thinking here is that it shouldn't really matter, the compiler should be able to tell if it can violate its contract

			
		* probably need a method to get collation from the locale		
		
		* Maybe compiler.line and compiler.char should be replaced with some more generalized stack refelction construct,
			which would be able to know not only the currenctly running line, but the line/character numbers of calling 
			statements higher in the stack.
			
		* [X+Y+Z || X <- [1,2], Y <- [3,4], Z <- [5,6]] 
		 vs
		 {1 2}.map[{3 4}.map[v2: {5 6}.map[v3:v+v2+v3]].join[a.cat[b]]].join[a.cat[b]]
		 Look at your comboset function
		 this might be done like this: comboset[{1 2} {3 4} {5 6}].map[v[0]+v[1]+v[2]]
		
		
		* I think I've stumbled upon this concept before, but shared libraries should *not* be 
			different from static libraries and executables - they really contain the same information. 
		  They're all binaries. The difference is in how you use them. 
		  The compiler should figure out which way is best to use them, tho. So you really need only 
		  one function:  lib[whatever] - uses either a static library or shared library
		   - whichever it deems best (probably usually the dll)
		   
		   
		* Investigate the lithe programming language - which I was never able to find any real information on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithe_(programming_language)
			* There is a paper you have to *pay* for which seems to be the only source of information for this language
			* there may be a similarity between lima's custom functions and the syntax-directed translation concept in lithe
